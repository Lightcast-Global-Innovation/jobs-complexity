# Jobs and Skills Complexity

Answering burning questions:
- How is demand for programmers changing over time?
- How widespread is demand for excel skills in the labour market? And what kind of level is required? 
- What are the skills accountants have a relative comparative advantage in? How spendible are they in the labour market?


Supporting policymakers:
- Education providers can use this data to shape their future course provision
- Employment agencies can better tailor and expand the support they give to people who are looking for jobs
- Local and regional organisation can use the insights to shape the economic development strategies in their region

In this repository you will find some presentasions and notebook about the economic complexity theory applied to online job postings data and structural labour market data from Lightcast.

We introduced four metrics: diversity, ubiquity, RCA and relatedness + two summary metrics.
